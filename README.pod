=head1 INSTALLATION

This module obviously needs Apache2, mod_perl2 and git binaries. It also uses System::Sub and File::MimeInfo.

On Debian Wheezy, you should be able to install them with these commands:

	aptitude install libapache2-mod-perl2 git libfile-mimeinfo-perl cpan
	cpan install System::Sub

Install this module in one of mod_perl2 @INC directories.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Here is a sample configuration with all the configuration parameters.

	# Load the module
	PerlLoadModule Apache::GitFileServer
	
	# Serve files from repositories
	<Location /pages>
		SetHandler modperl
		PerlResponseHandler Apache::GitFileServer
		
		# Where does the bare repositories live ?
		GitRepositoryRoot      /var/lib/git
		
		# Suffixes repository name with "-pages", e.g. /pages/myrepo => /var/lib/git/myrepo-pages
		# Default: -pages
		# GitRepositoryDirSuffix -pages
		
		# Redirect /pages/myrepo to /pages/myrepo/master
		# Default: master
		# GitDefaultBranch       master
		
		# Redirect /pages/myrepo/anyref to /pages/myrepo/anyref/index.html
		# GitDefaultIndex       index.html
		# GitDefaultIndex        index.html
	</Location>

=head1 CAVEATS

Even though this module should not consume much ressources, it has not been optimized for performance.
It executes "git cat-file" at least once per request and executes a second time to actually serve the file content.
